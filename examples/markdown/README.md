# React-Static - Markdown Example

This example is the most basic version of react-static available with support for markdown content. It includes:
- Babel
- CSS imports
- Image imports
- File imports
- Automatic Routing
- Markdown content with [jdown](https://github.com/DanWebb/jdown)

To get started, run `react-static create` and use the `basic` template.
